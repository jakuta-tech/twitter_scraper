# Twitter Scraper

The app is written in NodeJS and uses the Twitter Rest API to filter tweets by location, username, or topic. The documentation for the API can be found [here!](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)

In order to use this twitter scraper you must register as a Twitter developer and fill in the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token_key, and access_token_secret fields in the `server.js` file. To register as a Twitter developer see this [link.](https://dev.twitter.com/index)
